# Tools of the trade

Because sharing is fun!

## Background

In this repository, I will collect different material suitable for management consulting and the like. It's material that I have created primarily for my own use, but that I think might be interesting or useful to others.

## Acknowledgments

Some of these documents and files were created based on the works of others. In some such cases, use of the material might be subject to licensing of some kind. It is important that you read and understand the conditions in those cases.

In other case, when I have created new tools that are in whole or in part based on ideas laid forward by other people in books or the like, I will mention that. (If you for some reason object to my use of what you claim to be your original work, please let me know.)

If I am certain that I can claim to be the licensor, I might find it suitable to grant rights under a certain license. In those cases, it is also important that you read and understand the conditions that apply.
